    "He is the calm to my chaos, the reason to my emotions, the detailed plans to my tendency to leave tomorrow for later... And it‚Äôs this contrast that makes our love so unique and has helped us grow over these 12 years of history, filled with different phases, challenges, and the best partnership I could ever dream of. Always attentive, thoughtful, honest, and fair, he never takes shortcuts and is committed to doing what‚Äôs right, always. Intelligent, naturally curious, methodical, and detail-oriented, he dives deep into his hobbies‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs coins, spiders, or investments‚Äîwith maximum dedication and enthusiasm. He never does anything halfway, and that‚Äôs what makes him so special. And to top it all off, he genuinely cares about the people around him, being an amazing boyfriend, son, brother, friend, and the best pet dad ever! He is my biggest cheerleader and my safe harbor, and he‚Äôs the one I want to spend every day of my life with!",
  "us.statement.laiz":
    "Intelligent and communicative like no one else, Laiz has a unique way of winning everyone over. She makes friends as effortlessly as she breathes and has the gift of making everyone around her happier. She‚Äôs always thinking about how to brighten someone‚Äôs day, whether it‚Äôs with a small gift, a p√£o de queijo, or the right words at the right time. On top of that, she carries a beauty that blends elegance with a smile capable of transforming anyone‚Äôs day! Laiz is passionate about traveling and dreams of exploring every corner of the world, but it‚Äôs only truly worthwhile if she‚Äôs surrounded by the best company. She also knows how to enjoy life‚Äôs simple pleasures: a gourmet burger, family gatherings, lively bars, parties, and that cozy nap on the couch on a Sunday afternoon. She has mastered the perfect balance between energy and serenity. And it‚Äôs for her, with all these amazing qualities in just the right measure, that I fell in love!",

    "Dear,<br /><br /> Due to the recent developments in the Coronavirus pandemic, we decided to postpone our wedding again to April 15th, 2022, the same time and at the same venue. We are concerned about the health and safety of the more than 200 people with whom we would like to be together on May 2nd. üòî <br /><br />It would not be cautious to go forward with this date, so we decided to postpone our wedding until when, according to forecasts, the virus has already been controlled and the risk of contamination in agglomerations has decreased substantially. We chose the new date thinking about everyone who already has flight tickets and bookings scheduled, because we believe airlines and hotels will be more flexible. <br /><br />We understand that some changes will be required, and we are deeply sorry for all the inconvenience. But the health of our beloved family and friends, the people who live with each one of you, as well as the whole community, must come first. üôèüèª <br /><br />We are sure that this moment will soon pass and we ask that everyone stay healthy. We are closely watching the advance of the pandemic in Brazil and across the world news. It is essential that we avoid gatherings at this time, and the focus now should be to prevent the accelerated spread of the virus. We appreciate the understanding and please count on us for everything you may need. <br /><br />Our very special day will need to wait a bit, but we are sure it will be as special as the first one. And, for that, we need you with us on 04/15/2022! <br /><br />Please, don't forget to fill our new RSVP before 02/28/2022. <br /><br />See you soon! Lu & Hugo üë∞üèºü§µüèΩüß°",
