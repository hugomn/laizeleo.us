    "He turns any moment into something special. Since our first glance back in 2012, I fell in love with his calm, tranquil, attentive, and caring nature. Over these 12 years together, he has always believed in me, celebrated my victories, and been the best friend and partner I could ever dream of during difficult times.<br><br>Intelligent and rational, he is naturally curious and relentless in his pursuit of perfection in everything he sets out to do. Methodical, detail-oriented, and a collector of hobbies, he dives deep into each one of them ‚Äî from coins and spiders to stock market investments, always with the same dedication and interest.<br><br>He is someone who genuinely cares about the people around him, an amazing boyfriend, son, brother, friend, and the best pet dad anyone has ever seen! Honest and fair, he doesn‚Äôt take shortcuts and makes sure to always do the right thing.<br><br>He is, without a doubt, my safe haven and the person I chose to spend every day of my life with.",

    "She has a unique way of winning everyone over. Intelligent and communicative like no one else, Laiz shines wherever she goes. Highly competent, she is admired by everyone at work, where her talent is undeniable. In addition, she has a beauty that combines elegance with a smile capable of brightening anyone's day!<br><br>She makes friends as easily as she breathes and has a special talent for making everyone around her happier.

She also knows how to enjoy the simple pleasures in life: an artisanal burger, lively bars, parties, and, of course, a good nap on the couch on a rainy Sunday afternoon. She is the perfect balance between energy and tranquility. Laiz is, without a doubt, that person who transforms any ordinary day into something extraordinary.",

    "Dear,<br /><br /> Due to the recent developments in the Coronavirus pandemic, we decided to postpone our wedding again to April 15th, 2022, the same time and at the same venue. We are concerned about the health and safety of the more than 200 people with whom we would like to be together on May 2nd. üòî <br /><br />It would not be cautious to go forward with this date, so we decided to postpone our wedding until when, according to forecasts, the virus has already been controlled and the risk of contamination in agglomerations has decreased substantially. We chose the new date thinking about everyone who already has flight tickets and bookings scheduled, because we believe airlines and hotels will be more flexible. <br /><br />We understand that some changes will be required, and we are deeply sorry for all the inconvenience. But the health of our beloved family and friends, the people who live with each one of you, as well as the whole community, must come first. üôèüèª <br /><br />We are sure that this moment will soon pass and we ask that everyone stay healthy. We are closely watching the advance of the pandemic in Brazil and across the world news. It is essential that we avoid gatherings at this time, and the focus now should be to prevent the accelerated spread of the virus. We appreciate the understanding and please count on us for everything you may need. <br /><br />Our very special day will need to wait a bit, but we are sure it will be as special as the first one. And, for that, we need you with us on 04/15/2022! <br /><br />Please, don't forget to fill our new RSVP before 02/28/2022. <br /><br />See you soon! Lu & Hugo üë∞üèºü§µüèΩüß°",
